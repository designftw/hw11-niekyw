    I intended to make a general-purpose chat app with additional send functions. Those implemented include the following: 
    <ol>
      <li><b>Copy to Clipboard</b>: fully implemented. User can hover to the right of the send button for additional
        send options, including copy to clipboard. This enables users to move messages that have grown too long, perhaps if a group was drafting an essay for example.</li>
    
      <li><b>Send to Self</b>: fully implemented. User can use the same dropdown to send private messages to themselves, facilitating movement of messages between devices and as a reminder. 
        For ease of accessing the thread to themselves, a "chat with self" button has also been added to private messaging when
        the recipient user is not the same as the logged in user. </li>
  
      <li><b>Cosmetic and Animation</b>: General animations are added as appropriate, including stickied switching between channel and private messaging.</li>
    </ol>
	</details>
